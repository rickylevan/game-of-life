Game of Life in React
========

This project is a implementation of Dr. Steve Cox's "Game of Life", although the transition rules differ from the original. The implementation here is in React, based off of a template from Tyler McGinnis's React Fundamentals class. 

To run, clone the repo then enter, "npm install" then "npm start".
