React Fundamentals Video Project
========

#### This is the repository for the project we'll build together during React Trainings "React Fundamentals" course, for more information on the course see [reacttraining.com/online](https://reacttraining.com/online)

## Notes
Every video is coincided with a branch. If you want to compare your code with mine or you just want to play around with the code, check out the different branches on this repository.
